# DevSecOps

## Integrating Security into the CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline is the lifecycle of application development in an effective and secure state. It relies on Continuously Integrating (CI), in order to identify bugs and vulnerabilities in small code samples as apposed to pushing large changes at once. This prevents delays in development by identifying issues quick and fixing them quick. Once code has been commited, Continuously Delivery (CD) ensures that it is built and packaged with everything it needs, to be able to be deployed to production at any time. This delivery includes following through testing and pre-production enviornemnts, ensuring proper testing is done continously.

## Development Stages

## Plan

- Security Requirements: Discuss security requirments needed while planning out the application development. Logging, input validation, network security, etc. 
- Threat Modeling: Hypothesize the possible threats that the applciation could expect. Creating a visual representation of the system, assets, potential attack vectors, and vulnerabilities that could arrise.
- Risk Analysis: Identify the risks of the application, understand what data it may be processing, the application flow, and how compensating controls could be implemented in a layered security approach. 

## Develop
Integrating security checks into the code development, pre-commit stage of the pipeline in order to achieve secure coding. 

- Secure Code Training: Ensure developers are aware of secure coding best practices and utalizing methodology in code development.
- IDE Integration: Integrating security checks and secure code recomendations into IDE applications. (SAST)

## Build

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Scan for code level vulnerabilities. Identify unsanatized inputs, insecure code, and exposed sensitive artifacts. 
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Scan code for open source dependancies and libraries. Identify vulnerable dependancy versions.
- Manual Code Review: Identify malicious code and anything missed by automated scans.

## Test

- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Automated testing that attempts exploits against application.
- Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST): Manual testing against application to exploit common vulnerabilities.
- Container Scanning: Scanning the packaged application with its dependancies, and the container of configuration vulnreabilities, once bundled/built.

## Release

- Signing Code: Signing of code by its parent organization in order for it to be identified as an official release.
- Penetration Testing: Once the application has been deployed into a functioning enviornemnt. Penetration testing should be done on the servers hosting the application, as well as of the application itself.


## Monitor
- Ongoing security assesments: In order to ensure that application is secure against newly discovered exploits throughout software updates.
- Monitor: Monitor for security attacks and identify ways that attacks could be prevented or blocked more efficiantly.
- Learning: Through monitoring for attacks, Identify common threats and work with development teams to implement security recomendations.
