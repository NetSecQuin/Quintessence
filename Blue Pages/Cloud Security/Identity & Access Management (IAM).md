## Types of AWS Credentials

- Username and Password
- Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
- User Access Keys
  - Used to digitally sign API calls made to AWS services via HTTPS, CLI, or SDK
- AWS EC2 Key Pairs
  - Used for SSH/RDP access to EC2 instances. Doesn't show who uses the key, so best practice is to Add the EC2 instances to a directory domain for federated access, when access is required frequently.
