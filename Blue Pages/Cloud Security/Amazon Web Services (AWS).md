## Regions and Availability Zones

AWS offers the capability to host your devices, data, and networks from a variety of different data centers. This is covered through Regions, or locations like Washington or Signapore, and availability zones which are entirely isolated/seperated data centers in that locations or region. 

Choosing a **Region** and **Availibility Zone** is a big choice as there are certain factors that need to be considered when storing your data.
- The data center closes to your clients will provide the best user-experience.
- The Region may have certain costs associated to it (Higher electricity costs, infrastructure needs, and regulations impact region costs).
- The data stored may have certain compliance regualtions around the region or country.
- Disastor recovery backups may need to be stored at a different data center.
- Some regions do not offer all AWS services
