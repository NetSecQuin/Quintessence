## Summary

With AWS Step Functions, you can coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows so you can build and update apps quickly. Workflows are made up of a series of steps, with the output of one step acting as the input into the next. Step Functions can be used to design and run workflows that stitch together services, such as AWS Lambda and AWS CloudFormation, to respond to an incident in the cloud.

To learn more, see [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/).

# Use

- Create workflows where the output of one Lambda function can be pushed into a new Lambda function. Allowing for automating workflows.
- Preform automated incident response efforts, including isolating instances, collecting data, preforming basic analysis, and automated recovery.
