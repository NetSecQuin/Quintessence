## Summary

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that can be used to deliver data, including your entire website, to end users. CloudFront only accepts HTTPS and HTTP well-formed connections to prevent many common DDoS attacks. These capabilities can greatly improve your ability to continue serving traffic to end users during larger DDoS attacks.

To learn more, see [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).
