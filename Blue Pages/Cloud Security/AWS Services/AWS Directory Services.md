## Summary

AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, also known as AWS Managed Microsoft AD, enables your domain workloads and AWS resources to use managed Active Directory in the AWS Cloud. AWS Managed Microsoft AD is built on the actual Microsoft Active Directory and does not require you to synchronize or replicate data from your existing Active Directory to the cloud.

For more information, see [AWS Directory Service](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/).

## Use

- Build Microsoft Active Directory inside AWS.
- Extend an exsisting Active Directory configuration to the AWS Cloud.
- Manage user permissions and access tied to Active Directory users to AWS services and resources.
