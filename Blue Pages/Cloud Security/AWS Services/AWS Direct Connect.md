## Summary

AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that is used to establish a dedicated and secure network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation environment. In many cases, this can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.

To learn more, see [AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/).

## Use

- Directly connect your internal network or data center to AWS without passing through the full open Internet. Improves latency.
- Works by connecting to a location with a physical connection to the AWS network.
