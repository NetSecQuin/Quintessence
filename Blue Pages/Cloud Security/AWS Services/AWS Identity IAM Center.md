# AWS Identity IAM Center

## Summary

AWS IAM Identity Center is a cloud single sign-on (SSO) service that provides the central management of SSO access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications. Users can sign in to a user portal with their existing corporate credentials and access all of their assigned accounts and applications from one place. IAM Identity Center includes built-in SAML integrations to many business applications. It might be integrated with Microsoft Active Directory, which means your employees can sign in to your user portal using their corporate Active Directory credentials.

For more information about SSO, see the AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide(opens in a new tab).

## Use

Configuring SSO or SAML from your organizations LDAP (Active Directory) with AWS IAM.
