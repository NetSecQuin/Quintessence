## Summary

The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that gives you the ability to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for IAM users who are taking on a different role, or for users who are being federated. A scenario in which someone, or something, needs access to your account to perform a specific task that is not done on a daily basis would be a great candidate for temporary credentials.

For more information, see the [AWS Security Token Service API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html).

## Use

- Temporary credentials for an IAM user that needs permisions of a differnt role for a short time. Temporary elevated credentials for a specific task.
