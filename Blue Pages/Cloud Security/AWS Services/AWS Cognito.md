## Summary

With Amazon Cognito, you can add user sign-up, sign-in, and access controls to your web and mobile apps. You can define roles and map users to different roles so your app can access only the resources that are authorized for each user. User sign-in can be done either by a third-party identity provider, or directly through Amazon Cognito.

To learn more, see [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).

An Amazon Cognito user pool is a user directory that manages the overhead of handling the tokens that are returned from social sign-in providers, such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers through SAML 2.0. After a successful user pool sign-in, your web or mobile app will receive user pool tokens from Amazon Cognito. These tokens can then be used to retrieve AWS credentials through Amazon Cognito identity pools. These credentials allow your app to access other AWS services and you donâ€™t have to embed long-term AWS credentials in your app.

## Use 

- Used for customers of your web/mobile application to create accounts that can access credentials for AWS resources via AWS Cognito Identity pools.
- Users of your website sign in, and request data from an Amazon hosted database. Cognito provides AWS credentials that allow website user to make query.
