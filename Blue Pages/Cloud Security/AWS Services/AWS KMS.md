## Summary

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that helps you to create and control the keys used in data encryption. If you want a managed service for creating and controlling encryption keys, but do not want or need to operate your own HSM, consider using AWS KMS. You can use the key management and cryptographic features directly in your applications or through AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS. This includes AWS CloudTrail, which helps meet your auditing, regulatory, and compliance needs.
