## Summary

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that helps you to create and control the keys used in data encryption. If you want a managed service for creating and controlling encryption keys, but do not want or need to operate your own HSM, consider using AWS KMS. You can use the key management and cryptographic features directly in your applications or through AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS. This includes AWS CloudTrail, which helps meet your auditing, regulatory, and compliance needs.

More information on [AWS Key Management](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/).

## Use

- Create and manage crypotgraphic keys used for data encryption, without operating your own HSM.

## Key Management Service (KMS)
- Regional & Public Service
- Create , Store and Manage Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys
- The service provides cryptographic operations (encrypt, decrpyt)
- Keys never leave KMS Service to Provide FIPS 140-2 (L2)

### KMS Keys
- KMS Keys are logical and consist of an ID, date, policy, description, and state. They are backed by **physical key material**
- Keys can either be generated by the KMS service or importated
- KMS Keys can be used for encryption up to 4KB of data. It is used for generating other keys when encrypting larger amounts of data via a Data Encryption Key (DEK)
  - KMS will not store or track the usage of the DEKs for you. Either you will store it, or the service you are using will store it (Ex. S3 SSE w/ DEKs)
- KMS Keys have resource policies (Key Policy) that describe what AWS account is allowed to use it


### AWS Managed Keys
- Created by AWS when you use encryption in a service
- 1 per service per region  and named like aws/s3
- Usable by that service in that region only
- metadata can be read by the creator of the AWS account
- The key policy (resource policy) can **not** be changed. It is AWS managed. It will be rotated every 365 datys by AWS by default.
- No monthly cost , but has usage costs if you go past the free tier
- No cross-account usage due to the fixed key policy which locks it to the AWS account


### Customer Managed Keys (CSM)
- Are more configurable and can allow cross account access as you have full control of the key policy.
- This also means that the account trust restriction can be removed, or you can specific which accounts can use it. Restriciting access to AWS account administrators. 
- Can be used by services whihc support customer managed keys (CMS)
- CMK keys **can** be rotated automatacially , but the default is 365 days which can be disabled.
