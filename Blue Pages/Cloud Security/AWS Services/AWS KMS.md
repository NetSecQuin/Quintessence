## Summary

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that helps you to create and control the keys used in data encryption. If you want a managed service for creating and controlling encryption keys, but do not want or need to operate your own HSM, consider using AWS KMS. You can use the key management and cryptographic features directly in your applications or through AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS. This includes AWS CloudTrail, which helps meet your auditing, regulatory, and compliance needs.

More information on [AWS Key Management](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/).

## Use

- Create and manage crypotgraphic keys used for data encryption, without operating your own HSM.

## Key Management Service (KMS)
- Regional & Public Service
- Create , Store and Manage Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys
- The service provides cryptographic operations (encrypt, decrpyt)
- Keys never leave KMS Service to Provide FIPS 140-2 (L2)

### KMS Keys
- KMS Keys are logical and consist of an ID, date, policy, description, and state. They are backed by **physical key material**
- Keys can either be generated by the KMS service or importated
- KMS Keys can be used for encryption up to 4KB of data. It is used for generating other keys when encrypting larger amounts of data via a Data Encryption Key (DEK)
  - KMS will not store or track the usage of the DEKs for you. Either you will store it, or the service you are using will store it (Ex. S3 SSE w/ DEKs)
- KMS Keys have resource policies (Key Policy) that describe what AWS account is allowed to use it
 
### Customer Managed Keys (CSM)
- are more configurable and can allow cross account access
- CMK keys can be rotated automatacially
