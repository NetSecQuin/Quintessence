## Summary

Amazon GuardDuty is an intelligent threat-detection service that provides customers with a way to continuously monitor and protect their AWS accounts and workloads. GuardDuty identifies suspected attackers through integrated threat intelligence feeds and uses machine learning (ML) to detect anomalies in account and workload activity. It monitors for activity such as unusual API calls or unauthorized deployments that indicate that a customerâ€™s accounts might have been compromised. It also monitors direct threats, like compromised instances or reconnaissance by attackers.

To learn more, see [Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/).
