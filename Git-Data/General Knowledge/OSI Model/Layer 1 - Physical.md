# Layer 1 - Physical

Pairs together a *network card* or *reciever* (Something that can be configured to transmit and recieve bits across a medium) and a
A *physical shared medium* that allows the transfer of raw bit streams (binary 1s and 0s).

The only components involved are a device to transmit, recieve, and decipher changes in voltage or binary bits, and the physical connection between the two devices. 

Types of physical medium that allows this type of transfer:
- Copper (elctrical)
- Fibre (light)
- WIFI (RF)

At layer 1, all data is processed by all devices that are recieving the bits. There is no addressing, therefore there can be collisions where data becomes corrupt. There is also no protection against data collisions.
